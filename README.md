# Welcome to Omnifuneral ðŸŒŒ  

Hi there! Iâ€™m Dylanâ€”a developer, writer, tinkerer, and digital explorer. Iâ€™m passionate about crafting thoughtful tools and ideas, and rediscovering what relics of our digital past might deserve a place in our future. This space is home to experiments, projects, and collaborations that explore the intersections of software, art, and philosophy.

âœ¨ **About Me**:  
Iâ€™m a musician turned bike messenger turned coffee professional turned IT guy turned (aspiring) hacker and software developer. Each chapter in my story has shaped the way I approach creating and problem-solving today.  

I believe in building software that is simple, intentional, and ethical. My goal is to create tools that are as elegant as they are functionalâ€”software that serves people without unnecessary complexity or planned obsolescence. Iâ€™m deeply critical of the wasteful cycles of modern tech culture, and I hope my work and writing can offer a small counterpoint, emphasizing sustainability and user empowerment.  

Iâ€™m also fascinated by the challenge of giving old technology new life. From learning soldering to troubleshooting vintage hardware, Iâ€™m on a mission to repair, repurpose, and keep valuable tools out of the e-waste pile. Beyond the screen, I live in a quaint old house just outside Philadelphia with my lovely girlfriend and our endlessly entertaining dog. When Iâ€™m not hacking on FOSS, you can find me reading, hiking, playing basketball, or messing around on my guitar.
